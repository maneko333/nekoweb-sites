    <p>hiii i'm devin or maneko, either is fine!</p>
    <p>
      i'm <em>29 years old</em> and grew up on the old web and miss it dearly
      everyday. i'm so happy that there is a kind of .... resurgence in this
      diy web!
    </p>
    <p>
      i have a lot of different hobbies and interests so it can be tough for
      me to focus sometimes. i also am a <em> video game hopper</em>. anytime
      i start a game i quickly get distracted by a new release. i have a large
      steam library but have not completed many of them so i made a promise
      not to buy any new games until i finish some. (*/ω＼)
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>i really love</em> and am passionate about <em>music</em>. i have lots of favorites from all
      different genres. i love lyrics and analyzing them. i wish i could
      create my own music someday!!
    </p>
    <p>
      i'm working on this site in my spare time in-between my full time job
      and other hobbies so development has been kind of slow.. oops.
      <br />(￣ω￣;)
